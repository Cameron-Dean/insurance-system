# Insurance System

This repository is my implementation of Assignment 1 in the course SOFTENG 281: Object-Oriented Programming at the University of Auckland in Semester One 2023. The primary learning objective of this assignment was to apply OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

My code is located in the [src/main/java/nz/ac/auckland/se281/](src/main/java/nz/ac/auckland/se281) folder, with the exception of the Main.java and MessageCli.java files, which were provided.


### Functionality

The simple command line insurance system can:
- Add new clients
- Delete existing clients
- Add new policies for existing clients
- Calculate the cost of premiums for any given policy
- Calculate the total cost of premiums for all policies for a client
- Apply discounts for clients who have multiple policies


### Marking

The marking scheme included marks for functionality, object-oriented design, and code style. This achieved 100% for all sections.
